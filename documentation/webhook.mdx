description: Overview of how our Webhook works
---

A webhook is a callback function based on the HTTP protocol.

It allows a remote API to establish event-oriented communication with our API.

## Event

In our system, an event is a change in the parcel's status in the delivery process. When an event occurs, the webhook is triggered to inform external systems.

## How Our Webhook Works

1. **Subscription to Events**: The remote API (client) subscribes to events on our API by providing a callback URL where notifications for all events will be sent.
2. **Event Triggering**: When an event occurs within our system, a `POST` request is sent to the client's callback URL with details about the event.
3. **Payload**: The payload of the `POST` request contains information about the event, including the event type and relevant data associated with the event.
4. **Response Handling**: The client’s server processes the incoming webhook payload and responds with a status code to acknowledge receipt.

### Steps to Set Up a Webhook

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register a Webhook">
    Provide the callback URL to subscribet to all the events on a parcel. See
    [Create Webhook](/api-reference/webhook/endpoint/create-webhook)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Incoming Requests">
    Ensure your server can handle POST requests and process the incoming event
    data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Acknowledge Receipt">
    Respond to the webhook POST request with a 2xx status code to acknowledge
    successful receipt.
  </Step>
</Steps>
